> A brief description of the structure of our repository (i.e. what the folders contain)
- The **['root'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main)** folder contains the **['source'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main/source)** and **['test'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main/test)** folders, as well as the **['README.md'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/blob/main/README.md)** and **['UML.png'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/blob/main/UML.png)** files
- The **['source'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main/source)** folder contains the source files, **['GroceryProduct.java'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/blob/main/source/GroceryProduct.java)** and **['GroceryProductFactory.java'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/blob/main/source/GroceryProductFactory.java)**, to be used by **['TestDriver.java'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/blob/main/TestDriver.java)** in the **['test'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main/test)** folder
- The **['test'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main/test)** folder contains the **['TestDriver.java'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/blob/main/TestDriver.java)** file, which demonstrates that the source code stored in the **['source'](https://github.com/tahmid-chowdhury/SOFE3650U-assignment1/tree/main/source)** folder works
